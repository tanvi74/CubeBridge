# CubeBridge üöÄ

A modern query builder interface that enables dynamic data exploration through cube selection and automatic dimension filtering.

## ‚ú® What it does

- **Cube-Based Query Builder** - Select data cubes to automatically load relevant dimensions
- **Dynamic Joins** - Handles complex joins between related data tables automatically
- **Real-time Queries** - Execute queries instantly and see results in a responsive table
- **Smart Filtering** - Dimensions filter dynamically based on your cube selection
- **Clean Interface** - Focus on dimensional data without aggregation noise

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Cube.js** - Analytical API platform
- **SQLite** - In-memory database with sample data
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment

### Frontend
- **React 18** - UI library with TypeScript
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Ant Design** - UI component library
- **Cube.js React Client** - Frontend integration

## üìä Sample Data

The app includes two data cubes:
- **People** - Demographics (name, age)
- **PersonJobs** - Job information (job title, location)
